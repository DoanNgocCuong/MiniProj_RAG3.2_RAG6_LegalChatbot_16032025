# Report 1: Basic Chatbot Flow

## Overview
The chatbot is a legal assistant that helps users find information about maritime law and international collision regulations. It uses a combination of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and OpenAI's GPT model to provide accurate responses.

## Basic Flow

1. **User Interface**
   - Users access the chatbot through a web interface
   - The interface includes:
     - Chat history panel
     - Message input area
     - Reference questions section
     - Dark/light mode toggle

2. **User Input Processing**
   - When a user sends a message:
     - The message is captured from the input field
     - The source type (RAG) is determined
     - The message is sent to the backend API

3. **Backend Processing**
   - The backend follows these steps:
     a. **Initial Search**
        - First tries to find exact matches in the Qdrant database
        - Uses semantic search if no exact match is found
     
     b. **Response Generation**
        - If relevant documents are found:
          - Combines the context with the user's question
          - Sends to OpenAI for response generation
        - If no relevant documents:
          - Returns a default "no information found" message

4. **Response Display**
   - The response is displayed in the chat interface
   - Includes:
     - The generated answer
     - Source references (if available)
     - Loading indicators during processing

5. **Additional Features**
   - Chat history management
   - Reference questions for quick access
   - Source document viewing
   - Multiple chat sessions support

## Error Handling
- Network errors are caught and displayed to the user
- Invalid responses are handled gracefully
- Loading states are managed to prevent user confusion
